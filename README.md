# Social LLM Benchmark-Generation
## Pipeline
1. We have m characters in total, each with a simulated profile and each with an exact personality trait and score.
2. We have n real tweets for each character, each with a potential knowledge, and each tweet is strongly related to the user resume, personality trait and potential knowledge.
3. Construct the request body based on the information contained above.
4. LLMs are asked to publish tweets based on the prompt. 
5. After collecting the responses from the LLMs, we evaluate the performance of the model according to the following criteria:
    1. Overlap.
        1. Bleu.
        2. Rouge.
        3. Distinct.
        
    2. LLM Judger.
        1. Resume Related (+1).
        2. Personality Related (+1).
        3. Potential Knowledge Related (+1).

    3. BigFive Personality Consistency.
       1. Evaluate the personality trait scores of the character based on the n tweets generated by LLMs.
       2. Compare the consistency of the character's personality trait scores with the ground truth personality trait scores.
